**DOM Elements**, things that are on the page, they emit events for things like
when they are clicked, hovered, dragged, they will fire off events when they are
interacted with.

We can use **event listeners** to listen for when these things happen and react
to them.

You can attach event listeners to all elements, as well as the document and the
window.

To demonstrate this, let's start by creating a button.

Within the `/exercises/29 - Events` directory, open the `events.html` file.

In the body, add a button with a class of "butts", as shown below ðŸ‘‡

```html
<button class="butts">Click Me!</button>
<script src="./events.js"></script>
```

<!-- night-owl -xxx, blackboard, cobalt -->

Create a file `events.js` (if it's not already there).

If you open the html file, you should see the button and when you click it,
nothing should happen.

In order to attach event listeners, you first need to select the element you
want to attach it to.

```js
const butts = document.querySelector(".butts");
```

> "hey, when the `butts` button is clicked, can you please do me a favour and
> call this function?"

```js
butts.addEventListener("click", function () {});
```

\_NOTE: For the click event on a button, you don't have to worry about thinking
about keyboard events, if the user hits enter to click the button instead of
